# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

Get rating and summary from imdb through web scraping.

It is a python program which allows you to search any movie name. It gives all possible result and after choosing the best one it will show the summary and rating of that particular movie.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

Again its a python program which takes youtube URL as input (url of playlist) and then it will scrape all the links from the playlist and save it to youtube-playlist.txt file. After saving it will ask for you type those video numbers which you want to skip from downloading. After entering number it will start downloading.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

Had some problem working today. Even though I studied much about images scraping through python. For some time I got stuck while scraping Google Image Search but still will come up with solution.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

Created one program which will open URL and then it will scrape all the img tag. After scraping it will gather all the source of images and then it will save it locally with their respective extension. If extension is unknown then it will first confirm what is extension and then it will save it else it will ignore.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

One more project which reminds you if there is any new update on any one of your favourate youtube channel or not. Also I practiced 4 - 5 questions in Hackerearth and studied some Algorithm.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

Python Tweet follower geolocation projet which search geolocation of all followers of that particular page and then plot graph in ploty. Also studied C programming language. In Hackerearth site I participated in NIT Bhopal competition and secured 50th position among 500+ users.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

Learning Django and its looking quite complicated. Will start making project by tomorrow. Also updated my website and made project.html which will have all the information about my project. Also studied 1 Algorithm :D.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

Again learning Django + studying C + updated my website + Had some fun with compeititve programming + web scraping governement site to receive data related admit card.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

Started Youbot project which is python based project and the main concept which is used is scraping and data manipulation. Will try to use mechanize at some stage.

Day 3 of Youbot. Released Youbot v1.0 BETA. There can be so many bugs but yeah I have managed to make it working. More updates need to be made so that it can be used in much efficient way. Looking forward to get some positive response regarding my project.

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

Day 4 of Youbot. Today I was too lazy to do anything. Today I also didnt slept, I was just working on this project only. Feeling motivated after writing 500 lines of code. Today I Updated website + Fixed some bug too.

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

Rather than doing Youbot challenge today I studied few algorithms + Learned more about git. After all these thing I worked a bit for my Youbot program.


### Day 14: January 16, 2017

Today I mostly worked on Algorithms and then I solved one question in hackerearth and then for 1 hour I worked on Youbot adding download queue feature.

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

Youbot added playlistSearch function which helps you to search playlist video which can be downloaded it later. Also learned few algorithms.

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

Worked on new python projet Qypo which is a customizable typing helper. It will help you to increase your typing speed. Also going through this it will track all your progress and show them with the help of graph. Also Learned more about git and linux in enki app which is really awesome.

### Day 17: January 19, 2017

Worked on Qypo python project by adding more functions. Also had some introduction with Flask which is really interesting. Also studied few daily algorithms and later spent 1 hour with enki app studying git and linux.

### Day 18: January 20, 2017

Learn introduction to Flask and had some experience with some basics of Flask. Later studied about algorithms and then again followed enki study materials including git and linux. Also going to participate in January Circuits. Lets hope for the best so that I can increase by rating in Hackerearth.

### Day 19: January 21, 2017

Today was my bad day as i rarely give any time for my programming. But still I managed to do some work in Freecodecamp by solving some algorithm problems.

### Day 20: January 22, 2017

Created python project fabot which helps you to access facebook through program rather than using browser.
