# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

Get rating and summary from imdb through web scraping.

It is a python program which allows you to search any movie name. It gives all possible result and after choosing the best one it will show the summary and rating of that particular movie.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

Again its a python program which takes youtube URL as input (url of playlist) and then it will scrape all the links from the playlist and save it to youtube-playlist.txt file. After saving it will ask for you type those video numbers which you want to skip from downloading. After entering number it will start downloading.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

Had some problem working today. Even though I studied much about images scraping through python. For some time I got stuck while scraping Google Image Search but still will come up with solution.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

Created one program which will open URL and then it will scrape all the img tag. After scraping it will gather all the source of images and then it will save it locally with their respective extension. If extension is unknown then it will first confirm what is extension and then it will save it else it will ignore.
